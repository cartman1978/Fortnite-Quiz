### **Design Choices**

I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") to create a color scheme that matches the atmosphere of playing Fortnite Game.
The design choosed is simple but I would like to create cool and animated background.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the title of my game, I have used the font [Source Code Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Code+Pro?preview.text_type=custom).

#### Colors

I have decide to use some colors that reminds the background image used.

* Color #D12D6F is used for some buttons, progression bar and the endgame container.
* Color #E05A5C is used for main game box container.
* Colot #7A2D8D is used for the 4 possible answers to the questions.
* Colot #fff is used for all the text and headings.
